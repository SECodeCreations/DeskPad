Autosaving feature (will autosave note after certain intervals, even if the note hasn't been saved to a file).
Upon creating a new Note, a "temporary" file could be created (filename could perhaps be date/time stamp).
If the Note is saved, transfer the contents to the newly created SAVED file and delete temporary file.

When a saved note is opened, a "shadow copy" of the file is created and autosaved on until the file / program is closed.

Upon the program closing, save the current file (if no amendments have been made since saving the note, delete the shadow copy, else keep shadow copy).
